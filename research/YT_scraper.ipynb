That was a horrid example and a very disingenuous way to talk about it, even for a short part.

Again, as someone who has used this feature in dozens of games from beta to the 2.0 release, it NEVER, let me say it again, NEVER LOOKS AS BAD AS WHAT THEY JUST SHOWED lmao. AFMF may exist so AMD can say 'WE have FG in more games' but they do, and it actually works. Cyberpunk, RDR2, Mafia 3, Guardians of the Galaxy, Jedi Fallen Order, and GTA V (Legacy) are just a few of the MANY singleplayer games I play with AFMF on and its fantastic. Cyberpunk is a great example here because for all of the updates it has received since Phantom Liberty, somehow CDPR STILL cannot be bothered to implement FSR3.1 and allow FSR-FG to run with other upscalers, something many modern games have had for a while. Running Cyberpunk @ 1440p Ultra (No RT whatsoever) with XESS 1.31 on Quality + using AFMF & RIS (Radeon Image Sharpening @ 100%) nets a MUCH better gaming experience than with the native FSR implementation in that game. It's clearer, smoother, and no artifacts that one can see just playing the game, a 160FPS experience (80ish without AFMF), instead of zooming in 300x and slowing the game down by 75% to say 'LOOK, SEE THAT SPEC, AFMF SUCKS!' which is precisely why HUB lost me as a viewer. When AFMF came out, HUB completely ignored AMDs recommendations on how to use it for the best result including failing to educate their viewers on it, like how you should enable motion blur in game, a solid recommendation for using any FG tech. They showed it in the worst ways as well. They even showed it in games that I had JUST used AFMF, blow up the image and slow it down to point out tiny issues that nobody would have noticed just playing the game.

That YouTuber made the point that, at this price point and performance level, these cards are not going to put out the frame rates in most games to truly utilize the full bandwidth of the new HDMI and Display Port standards, so why sweat that detail? And that is a valid point, if you have the money for a high refresh rate, super high end 4K display that requires the newer versions of those ports, you are not wasting your time and money on looking at let alone buying a RTX 5070 Ti or an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT, and even the RTX 4080-5080.

The repairman reassured me everything would be fine. Days went by and my thoughts were consumed at school. Until finally I got a call with my heart racing. Only relieved when I was told the operation was success. At the end of day I was Uber’ed (mom) to the shop and able to pick up my dear friend. I re-assured myself things would be okay. For the next few years this was a cycle. Crash, repair, break, fix over and over and over again. Until one day I had been told “I’m sorry, I can’t fix this. It’s too old and worn out”. My heart stopped, and my entire life flashed before my eyes. Friends, family, all of them were unavailable. For years I reached to many others but could never find the success I needed to form that relationship I needed. So I would return home to my small dusty messed up computer. Finishing the day with some simple free to play games and YouTube. Yet that day was a countdown, until I could never hold that chance again. Years continued to go by. New friends, new relationships, girls. Yet I would always come home to my trusty computer that I built with my own hands. Trial and error, success and failure, but it was mine. Got a new job, and made more money but in the end the 1080Ti was mine and mine alone. *Tears start to form* Today though, marks a new day. A day it can finally rest. A day it can finally see peace. I looked at it one last time before I clocked on “Pre-Order”. In my mind, I saw myself as a child looking at myself as a a man now. No words were spoken between my past self, and I who I am now but I know what was said. My 10 year old self said me “it’s okay, you did well” I cried in that moment as I saw the 9070ti one screen. I don’t know if I ever really said the words, but I know I thought of them. I looked at my 1080Ti one last time. A little dusty, old, and worn out. I looked at it and said “You know I’m proud of you…right?” So I plugged it in one last time, and played a final time with it as our last dance. A token of brothers, a long standing relationship that withstood the test of time itself. Before I closed to case I made for it when I was a little boy and put it to rest one last time.\\n-\\nMay AMD be merciful on this weathered old soul.

I looked up the UL Procyon documentation, their scoring formula and which quants they are running. Now if they use INT4 with sparsity, then these test favor nVidia... except the 7900XTX has so much more raw FP16 and memory bandwidth, its AI TOPS should be competitive in dense INT4 compared to the 4070 and 3080. Yet they lose horribly. Why? Their scoring equation divides a \"constant value\" by the time to first token to calculate their \"score\" —if time to first token takes dozens of seconds to minutes, then maybe this would be a balanced test, but it don\\'t—it takes less then 1 second across all their prompt, it\\'s basically a multiplier, because they use a very small context window (2k) while their entire phi-3.5 benchmark take maybe 1-2 minutes in total to complete 7 prompts. \\n\\nGPU A (*cough*4090*cough*) can complete the Phi-3.5-mini benchmark is less than 50 seconds, with a average TTFT of around 0.25s, scoring 5000 points! But if GPU B has an average TTFT of 0.50s (adding 1.75 seconds total in the full benchmark); this would instantly halve their score. GPU B would have to generate double the tokens/s and complete the test in half the time to overcome this discrepancy in (memory) latency to get an equal score, despite being obviously better in such a case.\\n\\nTo give you an idea of how much this TTFT part of their scoring equation biases the test, and another major RED FLAG, is the 9070 score; RDNA4 should perform 4-8 times better in int4 OPs than RDNA3 architecturally, and the 9070\\'s have more AI TOPS than the 5070\\'s. They should generating more tokens/second in theory, especially in a benchmark that isn\\'t using CUDA. How much more? About 50%. Yet, it\\'s the 5070\\'s that score 50% higher!
