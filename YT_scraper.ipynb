Here is a Design Tip for you!  I know you're doing this chassis for a 19 inch wide by 72 inch high rack BUT I do suggest you move the power-supply out of the box itself into a SEPARATE rack that all the OTHER chassis get plugged into. If you are installing this in a typical commercial warehouse, you could ALSO design and build a single 16 RU high power box+UPS that goes into a separate rack that can handle the typical industrial-level 480 V at 1000 amps (480,000 Watts!) that uses Silicone Oil Immersion cooling to keep all the components SMALL and COOL! All the OTHER rack-mounted chassis can be plugged into the single separate rack and powered from there!\\n\\nStack the CPU's VERTICALLY within each 4 RU high box and have each CPU immersed in a box of Silicone Oil recirculated out to a global condenser unit that is located in a separate 72 inch rack. The fine-finned radiator system in the separate cooling fluid rack then blows the heat-exchanged air outside using a SINGLE QUIET FAN to an HVAC piping system that goes outside the warehouse! None of the 4RU CPU boxes should have a fan! They should only have Silicone Oil reservoirs and insulated tubing to suck out the heat via a single fluid pump which serves all 16 of the cooling fluid immersion CPU boxes!\\n\\nIn each 4 RU high rack chassis, mount the CPUs oriented sideways in a 4 x 4 array (i.e. 16 CPUs!) of the 192 core EPYC processors each immersed inside of a box fill with Silicone Oil cooling fluid which is dialectric (non-conductive!) and has enormous thermal capacity! Mount FOUR of the dual-width 16x PCI lane AMD Server GPUs racked SIDEWAYS at the front of the 4 RU high chassis AND ALSO immerse the GPUs in Silicone Oil for QUIET and COOL operation! Move the silicone oil via insulated tubing to OUTSIDE of the rack into the main condenser rack for final heat dispersal via HVAC piping to the outside and send the cooled fluid BACK to each 4RU chassis box! The 4RU rack contains NO INTERNAL power supply nor any cooling fans! Only silicone oil reservoirs and the pump to drive them and the electrical connections to a separate and external power supply+UPS and cooling racks!\\n\\nHire me and I will show you HOW it's done!\\n\\nV\", '3:52 So...no more thermal paste?
