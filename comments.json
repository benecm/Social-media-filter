Even so, the beginning of the song starts out perfectly with the chorus, beat, and the ethereal voice of the singer. So, in all, about a 1 min and 2 seconds into the song is what the whole song should have been composed of... mainly. But no, it isn't, and we have to suffer as it progressively gets bad after this point. Could have left the pauses in the beat out as well. However, the beat is ultimately what holds peoples interest for the rest of the song. Thank you Dr. Dre and Scott Storch.

    "Sir, This will work, but it has some security risks and disadvantages:\n\n 1. Security Risks: If we ever accidentally print your remote URLs (for example by running git remote -v), our token will be exposed. It's especially risky if we're in a screen-sharing situation, or if our terminal history is accessible to others.\n\n 2. Inconvenience: we would need to include the token every time you clone a repository or set a remote URL. This can be cumbersome, particularly if we are working with many repositories.\n\n 3. Token Expiry/Revocation: If your token ever expires or is revoked for any reason, you'll need to update all the places where we've hard-coded the token\nCould you make video on  how to use git credential helper in Ubuntu?",

    "The lyrics were written by a 14 year old... possibly younger. Or at least it sounds that way. So very stupid. Even so, the beginning of the song starts out perfectly with the chorus, beat, and the ethereal voice of the singer. So, in all, about a 1 min and 2 seconds into the song is what the whole song should have been composed of... mainly. But no, it isn't, and we have to suffer as it progressively gets bad after this point. Could have left the pauses in the beat out as well. However, the beat is ultimately what holds peoples interest for the rest of the song. Thank you Dr. Dre and Scott Storch. For me however, I discard it as wasted potential to my trash-bin of internet jingles.",
