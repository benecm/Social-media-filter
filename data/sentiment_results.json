        "Comment": "I'm going to sound absurdly pessimistic here, but this whole video is so \"same-y\" to me. It's seemingly the same results from AMD as we got last generation, with the XTX cards. They do well, but fall just short of the mark in comparison. I completely understand (and actually love) that gamers are able to get \"mostly\" affordable cards, even if they'll be flying off shelves, and scalped for a slightly higher cost, at least for a long while, but AMD just doesn't seem to want to \"beat\" Nvidia, and that's really a shame. AMD has come SO far in the CPU world, where, for many many years, they were almost completely out done by Intel (Except in the case of workstation, but I'm talking about gamers here.) and now AMD is even starting to hold dominance in the CPU world, even over Intel, which I absolutely LOVE to see, because MORE competition makes the market BETTER, and drives larger improvements from all sides. The problem, is that, from what I've seen last generation, and this generation, is that AMD just wants to be the affordable, but not quite \"amazing\" card. They just want to be the average card, that isn't as good, but more people have access to it. I don't like that, because, ultimately, at the end of the day, everyone 'wants' the top of the line Nvidia card. If every gamer were given an unlimited budget for a gaming rig, they'd almost all surely buy the 5090 right now, and that kinda sucks, because while Nvidia sits atop the mountain of performance, AMD doesn't seem to be making a run for the crown, and that makes a stagnant market. It really ultimately hurts both AMD and Nvidia in this case, because Nvidia (As we've seen with both the 40 and 50 series) have been having some serious issues, with the power connectors, and horrible, horrible launches, making an $2,000 MSRP card almost immediately cost $5,000. I want to see AMD make a REAL card. A card that REALLY shoots for the top, EVEN if it comes at a much higher price tag. I want to see AMD make Nvidia sweat. Make Nvidia nervous. Make Nvidia have to CARE about their products again.",

No Ai search results are going to have DirectML as the first option. Tests needs to be done on a platform that supports both Drivers compatibility. for AMD its ROCm and Nvidia its Cuda . This performance test doesnt bring any value to productivity .",

But now i am more of a AMD person, but not a fanboy, i think at least. But i am generally happy for the new GPU¬¥s from Intel, seams to work nice for their prices, and that¬¥s all i am asking for. Nvidia is way to expensive and no one asked for RT than can be calculated on the CPU. that's how it was done before Nvidia forced us into RT. And i am a little bit sad that AMD still keeping higher prices on their cards even tho they are lower than Nvidia. But as long Nvidia keep their prices high, AMD can keep their prices high also, just slightly lower than Nvidia. So from that perspective i like Intel adding some price competition with their cards that seams to be good also.",

So when you say that it proves it is one generation behind that is the wrong statement to make, you are  probably right that they are a generation behind, but that game cant be used as the proof. \n\nMulti frame generation is a gimmick, it basically the most useless feature that I have seen from Nvidia. You can use it when you don't need, and when you need it the game feels worse for it.  The only rational use case I can see for it is if the game you are playing has an unstable frame time graph making the game a stuttering mess, and that would only reasonably work when you have enough frames.\n\nIn terms of AI I don't know about it the really give a opinion, but the 9070XT is supposedly a mid range card, so in that context wouldn't be unreasonable to expect it beat last generations flagship card. I know they have mentioned improvement with AI, but according to your own graphs there is a improvement and in some cases it beats its own last generation flagship.",

        "Comment": "@Linus Crew: Regarding @10:30 : I do. I want this. \n\nThe ability to lock my FPS at 120 and run FMF to double that to 240 for my 240hz monitor has been my favorite new feature added to either GPU brand in years (and I'm very excited that NVIDIA has this scheduled to come out soon for the 40 series cards so I can compare with my partner's GPU). Unlike 60 vs 120 input latency, the feel of 120 vs true 240 input latency is much, much less noticeable and the FMF smoothing has been a god send for still hitting my refresh rate cap at 1440p in this modern era of games shooting for seemingly 60FPS performance before framegen without having to set everything in games to the absolute bare minimum settings. I have also found that FMF2 has way, way more stable frames in certain games such as MHWilds and Darktide, where turning on FSR3.1FG just murders my FPS. Even more importantly, I CAN TURN ON FMF WHILE USING XESS TO GET AROUND THE HORRIFIC PIXELATED MESS THAT IS FSR3. Though, if the rumors are true and FSR4 is coming to 7000 cards later, I'm excited to compare in person without the horrific youtube compression.\n\nAlso, regarding FMF2.1. I don't know why it seems to be different in your examples, but in both Path of Exile and Darktide, my most recent games I've been playing, there was a noticeable removal of ghosting in my Steam Overlay FPS, which used to look like it was performing tiny Alucard backdashes all over the corner of my screen and now, when observing casually as it didn't bother me in the first place, I haven't actually seen an example of that happening.",

Shipping ground in canada is slow wont have it until next week mid week.\n\nSucks the MSRP cards were mostly sold at physical locations in north america but it was a good way to get cards into hands of those that wanted them and not snagged by bots.\nThe biggest issue i seem to see is that for some reason everyone thought every card would be a base level msrp card when it was probably around 20% of total stock was products designed to sell at the msrp level.\nThere is also confusion about the msrp because stores bought the cards at the higher msrp before it was lowered by amd . \nAll future cards at the mrsp base level will still be $600, the rebate will no longer be needed as the next shipments of gpus will be purchased by the retailers at a price that reflects the lower msrp.\n\nPeople like to complain and assume something means something entirely different than what was actually said just looking for a reason to explode in anger.",

Keep in mind that i have had only a few cards, but never had the issue with AMD that i have had with Nvidia. And i think that the grapgics from AMD have looked better visually.

Only partner cards.\n\nI'll get it tomorrow, excited to see how Team Red can do for me these days. I've used nVidia GPUs since 2008...

Unfortunately, the $600 cards had already been purchased by the time I got there. I figured this might be my last chance for a while to score a card at this performance tier, so I got the Hellhound for $750. It definitely stings a little. This is my first AMD gpu. I have yet to install it, but I totally trust AMD with their drivers. I actually do not really like AMD. I feel like they have been extremely meek competitors. THIS gpu is the first since the 290x that, imo, actually is a reasonable alternative to Nvidia. Finally, they are actually putting up a fight against Nvidia with upscaling and RT performance. Their RT performance and upscaling quality was unacceptable for RDNA 3 and 2. I wanted to show my support. So finally, I get to actually talk shit on AMD, without being labeled a fanboy, if they start getting dragged again. I also have the 7800x3d and the 7900x. Don't ever call me an Nvidia fanboy again! Also, good job AMD, keep it up and please don't give up in the high end! Oh, also, plz plz plz make an ml sdr to hdr converter.",

When you disable framegen it limits to what you see.\nBut with gpu driver fps limit you have to set it based on the total fps instead of real fps, and when you disable framegen, then it will break and limit to half of the value instead so if you have a 120 fps limit in gpu drivers it will be 60 instead, until you restart the game and don't toggle framegen on and off on next run.\nIn 1 game I had to set in drivers to 180 fps limit, so I could get 90 fps limit in the game, otherwise the 90 fps limit limited to 45 instead, regardless if framegen was on or not.\nThe in game fps limits seem to be so far reverse of gpu driver fps limits, if they're bugged or don't describe properly what they're doing.\nIn indiana jones for example, while you're in the menus, the framegen doesn't even work until you close out of the menu, so you might be sometimes like is it even working, or is some fps limit nonsense going on.",

Pricing is out of touch with everyone that can barely get by, and yet most mid to high end gpus are sold out and scalped into 3 party sites 2 or 3 times the price. Plus, the hardware and sometimes the software issues or even the game itself breaks the card itself. Doesn't include the cpu in conversation as they have their issues. Perhaps a console or a handheld or even your smart phone is enough with gaming. Pc companies are out of touch with the main core of their consumers and more or less focusing on AI. They don't care, and we as individuals should boycott them with our wallet, but I know this isn't a possibility. Add to inflation,  supply chains, trump tariffs, price gouging, and there isn't any normal priceing ever going to exist.So, the cycle continues of predatory practices. ü´£ü´£ü´£ü´£ü´£",

That card has 8billion more transistors than a 5080 and performs worse. How is that possible? They obviously took the last 2 months to reevalute sale price, and they most certainly took a hit to their margins to launch the card at that price. 8 billion transistors literally means more manufacturing costs from more materials, and higher chance of manufacturing defects (ie. lower yield). The normal 9070 on the other hand looks like a good card.\n\nIf you think their cards are being sold at these prices to do gamers a service you're sorely mistaken. When one company has 70% margins and the other has 40%, it's pretty clear AMD is doing this just to survive. It's so disinegenuous to praise AMD for these cards, when 1. they had no choice but to sell at this pricepoint, 2. they had the benefit of delaying by 2 months for stock (a completely reactive action,  not proactive), 3. the 9070xt actually just sucks.\n\nWhy are you guys not highlighting how horrible the power draw is of the 9070xt? You literally just glanced over it like it wasn't completely atrocious.",

Nvidia has for years only had to compete with itself, now finally they have to look at AMD and go okay, they aren't a threat to us today because they can't figure out that demand does play a role in pricing, but if AMD next series comes at them again, and decides to take a hit to get market share for once?

As there are NO reference cards, no \"founders\" cards if you like, there is not really any cards that will be sold for MSRP.  So the 550 and 599 numbers are dust.\n\nReality is going to be 700-800 for the XT, and somewhat less for the non XT - and the non XT will probably end up settling down to right around MSRP after a wile.   However, if the XT is as good as advertised, I think you won't seem them drop for a long time to come, unless the market gets absolutely flooded.\n\nAlso, let's make it clear - even at $600, there is no \"value proposition\" here.  They are all massively overpriced all things considered.   They only look good because NVidia has become possibly the greediest company in the computer market, their prices are insane.   Getting all of the rest of the PC for less than the GPU is off the hook cray cray.",

        "Comment": "The raw BOM cost of the 9070XT is basically no more than the BOM cost of the 7800XT which had an MSRP of $499 and regularly sold for $450. Sure I get that 4nm is ever so slightly more expensive than 5nm but at the same time GDDR6 prices have come down, other costs like shipping and general inflation might have also increased but I think AMD could have been more aggressive if they really really wanted to, but $599 in the current climate of basically 'no competition from Nvidia' is good enough and will sell very well. The 5070Ti is certainly not worth $300-400 more than the 9070XT, but AMD needs to be really careful because if Nvidia sorts themselves out (this could happen if it's yield issues or something else we don't know) and start to fill shelves with $749 cards then 100% AMD can not look to charge $650-700+ for this card which has been rumoured once all the MSRP cards are sold. \r\nThe 5070Ti is better in every single way, but it's just not '$300 better', but most buyers including myself would happy pay $50-100 more for better overall performance, better power usage, better ray tracing, better and wider DLSS support, Reflex, HDR, better encoding quality, better support in content creation apps, Cuda, the list goes on. I genuinely had my heart set on a 5070Ti this year (I've not owned Nvidia in about 20 years!) but the performance increase wasn't that impressive and the pricing/available is just ridiculous. Thankfully AMD looks to have got their sh!t together this generation, it's a solid card, decent performance, they are addressing their shortcomings and they have *currently* priced this card where it needs to be in the market we have right now. But honestly, AMD can't go north of $600 long term as this card simply isn't good enough against a $749 5070Ti, imo.",

As pointless as it feels a lot of the time, personally, it's here to stay and is now the standard. So being even just a generation behind is still a big hit on value.

And AMD being so late in this segment makes me never wanna pick their brand until they somehow make it up for real in both performance and quality.\n\nWhy would I purchase a GPU that has better RAW performance when I can just toggle a setting on a menu that makes it perform way worse to his competitor without me noticing anything?\n\nI'm no NVidia fanboy, but I just wish AMD wouldn't focus so much on RAW and more on AI a bit more. While I also wish NVidia focuses more on RAW instead of all-in on AI to a ridiculous point.\n\nAnd while I hear pricing goes through the roof, I got my RTX 4070 (non-super) for 485‚Ç¨ Brand-New back in Nov 2023, so there's still possibilities of getting good NVidia prices if you're ready to be patient and be hunting prices and pricing bugs on websites.",

Add all the other features that are better than last year but still worse than NVIDIA and I'm really struggling to see it as a win. It's not worse than NVIDIA but again, it's not better either. They're just filling in some price gaps between the 5070 and 5070ti. The only thing they could possibly do is to actually making them appear in stock.",

Idk why but if you use FsR 3 frame gen by forcing it with a mod the ghosting is bad but AFMF2 is actually pretty tame with it. It only appears when panning really fast. It‚Äôs definitely useful and makes games like Arkham knight way better. Being able to play at 120 fps in games that are engine locked at low fps is a game changer. Same with Elden Ring. even in your example of bashing on it you were doing these erratic fast camera pans. Like yeah no shit it‚Äôs gonna ghost.

So we got a GPU that costs $150 less than last gen and is negligibly better than the last gen and everyone was roasting the 5080 for being 25% better than the 4080 which launched for $1200 while the 5080 launched for $1k... It's cool, lets yell at Nvidia to do better, but lets not high five AMD for doing the same crap.  At least they dropped the price. When it was planned to launch in January, AMD had the price for the 9070xt set for $899. Then they got wind that the 5070ti was going to be $750, so they pushed the launch back so they could drop the MSRP and pay their AIBs back. Then they came up with some BS about how the 9070xt is actually supposed to replace the GRE... If you got this far congrats, you are now informed.",

I'm sure 4k is nice, but until it's both nice and very affordable, I'll treat it like it doesn't exist. And very affordable means 400 dollars tops for a 5080 or so, with everything trailing down and the mid range gpus being around 200 bucks. You know... kinda how it used to be? And before someone starts flipping gums about how money lost value - so what? Salaries have hardly moved to offset. Who is this hardware for? Even if 85% buy stuff under 700 usd, it's most likely even more extreme when you start shifting the needle. What do 84% buy? Under 600? 83%? Under 500? 10/10 the numbers are rigged to make some arbitrary shareholder profit number match. Gotta gaslight the audience that a bunch of transistors blasted into a chunk of silica is somehow worth as much as a second hand city car.",

It should be neck and neck with the 5080 since Nvidia hard hardly any uplift this gen. Why are people celebrating this so much, both sides are stagnanting to milk the consumer on top of adding inflation costs and at leat 20%+ on top of MSRP. If we were to adjust for actual inflation the XT should be $500. Just because Nvidia is being even greedier and the scalpers just f*cking insane doesn't mean we should reward any \"sides\" behaviour. Honestly this entire generation should be skipped. I do praise AMD for the RNDA and RT improvements though. As is from hardware unboxes the XT is 15% slower than the 5070ti not the same or faster like the AMD fanbois are saying. Nvidia is just pure f*cking a** and trying to fleece their consumer for as much as they can.TLDR: Only upgrade to the 9070XT if you really must and are using a gpu 3+ generations old. OTHERWISE SKIP THIS ENTIRE GENERATION. AMD didn't do enough and is just doing the status quo again because its profittable for them when Nvidia raises MSRP and scalpers ruin the entire market. Don't reward intentional stagnation and market price manipulation.",

Most of the ai models and hardware fp16/fp32 gpu compute acceleration paradigms are very specifically written for CUDA, making them not work on AMD cards - including ai models, media apps, and specific proprietary apis in games.  the last time I bought an amd card was a looong time ago, it was a 7970x and I was soooo bummed when I couldn't get the physx effects my friends were seeing. - what we really need is an open, unified low level api that everybody can get behind.  something simple, optimized, and documented enough that in 20 years we can emulate it on more commodity hardware.  stop with all this proprietary api manure, and create an even playing field for everyone to innovate on.  of course the liklihood of this happening, without external regulation, is worse than buying a winning lottery ticket, but *shrug*",

AFMF is good, its great actually, and as someone who has used it since it's first beta years ago, it has come a long way. Again, as someone who has used this feature in dozens of games from beta to the 2.0 release, it NEVER, let me say it again, NEVER LOOKS AS BAD AS WHAT THEY JUST SHOWED lmao. AFMF may exist so AMD can say 'WE have FG in more games' but they do, and it actually works. Cyberpunk, RDR2, Mafia 3, Guardians of the Galaxy, Jedi Fallen Order, and GTA V (Legacy) are just a few of the MANY singleplayer games I play with AFMF on and its fantastic. Cyberpunk is a great example here because for all of the updates it has received since Phantom Liberty, somehow CDPR STILL cannot be bothered to implement FSR3.1 and allow FSR-FG to run with other upscalers, something many modern games have had for a while. Running Cyberpunk @ 1440p Ultra (No RT whatsoever) with XESS 1.31 on Quality + using AFMF & RIS (Radeon Image Sharpening @ 100%) nets a MUCH better gaming experience than with the native FSR implementation in that game. It's clearer, smoother, and no artifacts that one can see just playing the game, a 160FPS experience (80ish without AFMF), instead of zooming in 300x and slowing the game down by 75% to say 'LOOK, SEE THAT SPEC, AFMF SUCKS!' which is precisely why HUB lost me as a viewer. When AFMF came out, HUB completely ignored AMDs recommendations on how to use it for the best result including failing to educate their viewers on it, like how you should enable motion blur in game, a solid recommendation for using any FG tech. They showed it in the worst ways as well. They even showed it in games that I had JUST used AFMF, blow up the image and slow it down to point out tiny issues that nobody would have noticed just playing the game. Gotta do better guys, especially with the Labs. An otherwise okay review.",

Let NVIDIA move away from the market and expand the potential market share for Intel and AMD.\n\nIntel having a motivation to try and make an enthusiast card will be really good for the market; AMD backing out of the enthusiast market might be a bit of a red herring given that they'll still be putting out workstation cards of equivalent performance. I suspect if Intel actually made a gaming-capable enthusiast card AMD would quickly re-spec a W series to get a 32gb monster out (that would cost like $2,700 but hey, it'd beat the 5090 in 8k performance with that massive VRAM.",

That YouTuber made the point that, at this price point and performance level, these cards are not going to put out the frame rates in most games to truly utilize the full bandwidth of the new HDMI and Display Port standards, so why sweat that detail? And that is a valid point, if you have the money for a high refresh rate, super high end 4K display that requires the newer versions of those ports, you are not wasting your time and money on looking at let alone buying a RTX 5070 Ti or an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT, and even the RTX 4080-5080. Those people go straight to the new Titan series cards of the current era, the RTX 4090-5090 cards, when they can find them. To me, without using the gimmicks, AMD has closed the gap hugely on Nvidia in the mid-tier. And, IF the price points stick even remotely close to MSRP, I would be happy to upgrade from my RTX 2080 Super to a Radeon RX 9070 XT, versus either a RTX 5080 or 5070 Ti. I don't need 4K gaming, and AMD just made a card with enough rasterization performance to play 99.9% of my game collection just fine maxed out at 2560x1440 and 100Hz, for $600.00 MSRP. It would do ray tracing in the games I have with it as an option WAY better than my current card, and I would never need to touch FSR. I can't care about newer games right now, there is nothing out or coming in the near future that I care to own, when I have a collection now I can never hope to complete.\n\n TL:DR Bravo to AMD for finally making a mid-tier card to compete with Nvidia, and under cut their stupidity and lies. If pricing stays stable (doubt it) I just may have to finally upgrade again, and back to an all AMD configuration.",

I own a 4070 ti so there's not enough of an upgrade for me to go team red gpu to match my 7700x cpu, but with the RTX 5000 series pretty much D.O.A. with poor performance, high power consumption, and still the too-much-voltage-through one cable issue causing melting... it is a cheap year for pc owners.. upgrading from the RTX 2000 or even 3000 series willl mean AMD gpu's are the best option, the second best option is to wait a few more years and hope Nvidia learn from this and stop hyping poor performance boosted with A.I. frames and make better gpu's next time. It will also mean a big drop in sales from unoptimised games with huge pc spec requirements",

Those were beautiful days, but all things must come to an end. I noticed that my 1080Ti looked worse for wear one day. I thought nothing of it, it happens I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be okay. Days went by, weeks, months‚Ä¶until finally it broke. In that moment I was in a panic. A friend to me, near and dear had crashed. Fallen and unable to get up. I quickly rushed to the repair center and asked for assistance, I couldn‚Äôt let it die. The repairman reassured me everything would be fine. Days went by and my thoughts were consumed at school. Until finally I got a call with my heart racing. Only relieved when I was told the operation was success. At the end of day I was Uber‚Äôed (mom) to the shop and able to pick up my dear friend. I re-assured myself things would be okay. For the next few years this was a cycle. Crash, repair, break, fix over and over and over again. Until one day I had been told ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt fix this. It‚Äôs too old and worn out‚Äù. My heart stopped, and my entire life flashed before my eyes. Friends, family, all of them were unavailable. For years I reached to many others but could never find the success I needed to form that relationship I needed. So I would return home to my small dusty messed up computer. Finishing the day with some simple free to play games and YouTube. Yet that day was a countdown, until I could never hold that chance again. Years continued to go by. New friends, new relationships, girls. Yet I would always come home to my trusty computer that I built with my own hands. Trial and error, success and failure, but it was mine. Got a new job, and made more money but in the end the 1080Ti was mine and mine alone. *Tears start to form* Today though, marks a new day. A day it can finally rest. A day it can finally see peace. I looked at it one last time before I clocked on ‚ÄúPre-Order‚Äù. In my mind, I saw myself as a child looking at myself as a a man now. No words were spoken between my past self, and I who I am now but I know what was said. My 10 year old self said me ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, you did well‚Äù I cried in that moment as I saw the 9070ti one screen. I don‚Äôt know if I ever really said the words, but I know I thought of them. I looked at my 1080Ti one last time. A little dusty, old, and worn out. I looked at it and said ‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm proud of you‚Ä¶right?‚Äù So I plugged it in one last time, and played a final time with it as our last dance. A token of brothers, a long standing relationship that withstood the test of time itself. Before I closed to case I made for it when I was a little boy and put it to rest one last time.\n-\nMay AMD be merciful on this weathered old soul. For I know not how many more days I have left, before I too may rest and never wake up again.",

That seems VERY quick? So, these FPS pushing over 100-120 frames, and people complaining that this is only a 5-10% boost over last gen, is that a downside? It still seems quick enough.\n\nAlso, you need a monitor that supports 120hz .. right? So, you need an actual high quality gaming monitor with high refresh to even display the frames that are being made.\nIf you have a <100hz monitor, what happens to the frames that can't be displayed? Do they just get dropped? Should you limit the FPS to 60 or whatever your refresh is to get exact speeds without dropouts?\n\nPlease let me know! What's the fastest Hertz refresh monitor available and how much does that cost? The better it is in one area, then the worse it is somewhere else, right? Better refresh, means smaller resolution or overall screen size?\n\nWhat's the best of all worlds?",

Now, in my opinion they should immediately drop the MSRP price for the 9070 to $499, $50 difference compared to the XT version is not enough, most people will go for the XT version, if they do this both 5070 and 5070 TI will have a fierce competition.\r\n\r\nI have been an Nvidia user all along, now, at least for this generation I will continue to rock my 4070 Ti, it still performs amazingly at 1440p and the new DLSS Transformer model is great, plus I will wait for the Smooth Motion update ‚Ä¶and maybe a 3X MFG implementation to RTX 40 Series at some point?  ü§î But for my next GPU upgrade in a future generation I will seriously consider AMD seeing where they stand right now üëåü§ò hopefully Ray Tracing performance will also considerably increase by then in their architecture.",

I had a 7700 XT, and while it worked great in most cases, it struggled in some niche areas I actually enjoy‚Äîareas where my old 1080 Ti had no issues.\n\nOne major problem I encountered was with Steam Link and other home streaming services like Parsec and Moonlight. The 7700 XT has a known issue where streaming will freeze (though the game itself keeps running), forcing you to restart the stream. This happened anywhere from once an hour to every 10 minutes, which was incredibly frustrating.\n\nAnother issue was with Diablo 4. Many users, including myself, reported that after a loading screen, the game would show a black screen with only the UI elements, making it unplayable. On top of that, I experienced serious stuttering and freezing, which Diablo 4 is known for, but it was way worse on my 7700 XT compared to my 1080 Ti.\n\nI also had problems with Hogwarts Legacy and Elden Ring. Something‚Äîeither RTX or FSR, I‚Äôm not sure which‚Äîbugged out, causing serious stuttering and screen blinking. I suspect it was a combination of FSR, RTX, and faulty drivers, because after a driver update, the issue disappeared.\n\nSpeaking of drivers, I had the 7700 XT for 3‚Äì4 months, and in that time, I only saw one driver update. Meanwhile, NVIDIA releases driver updates so frequently it‚Äôs almost annoying.\n\nAfter dealing with all of this, I finally gave up, sold the 7700 XT, and bought a 4070 Super‚Äîand honestly, I‚Äôm pretty happy with it.",

The time of \"lets build a console killer\" are officially over when you spend nearly twice as much for a GPU already without the rest of the rig compared to a PS5 or XBox One X.\n\nI'm looking for an upgrade of my 10 gig 3080, but I'm not selling my sould, or a kidney, to pay for it. if my GPU would die I would just revert to 1080p gaming instead of 1440p and just buy a 300 Euro GP(U for that.\n\nBut, it's good AMD seems to give NVidia some competition, team Green will have to respond by dropping the price of the 5070Ti and 5080's. 5090's are insanely expensive here at the store with a 4000+ Euro pricetag which is ridiculous and should be illegal.",

The problem was fixed for UDNA (RDNA5), but AMD wouldn't be able to fix Navi41 and Navi42 in a reasonable time.  The only way AMD can deliver a \"high end\" GPU is if AMD had sufficient work done for a non-leaked chip, like Navi43 for example, that was designed similar to Navi31's single compute die + multiple memory controller dies.  The rumors of a 32GB \"gaming\" card could be anything from a special Navi48 die with double VRAM, dual Navi48, or AMD had work on another RDNA4 die that wasn't leaked.  If AMD had a back-up high end GPU, why not push it instead of Navi48?  AMD expected the RTX 50 series to be great, and thus such a chip still would not make sense.  Regardless of such speculation, the best chance for an RDNA4 high end GPU is a mid-generation release, if AMD thinks it is viable.  Given that stores need supply and how much hardware troubles Nvidia is having for their RTX 50 series launch, conditions may \"now\" be viable for the back-up high end RDNA4 GPU.\n\nGiven how badly the RTX 50 series launched, will these problems influence how soon or how late the RTX 60 series comes?  Jensen should be upset with how much the entire internet is mocking his CES presentation of the RTX 50 series.  It is too late to unlaunch the RTX 50 series and delay it 6 months to fix everything.  Not only should Nvidia be fixing the RTX 50 series, they need to evaluate the risk that the RTX 60 series could repeat all of these mishaps.",

Too bad all the available 9070's are being combo 'ed on Newegg so you basically have to buy a entire PC to get one of these. When is official launch date?",

Oh and also, for some odd reason this never gets brought up in any of these video reviews, you can just buy that gpu and expect to dee that difference in performance compare to what you have. They sre using latest CPU in this comparisons. I have a 5900x paired with this 6800xt. If I was to just buy a 9070xt I will not see more than a 20% performance increase at 1440p. I would need to upgrade my CPU as well and there we go again down the rabbit hole. Heck NO",

It doesn't even beat Nvidia in Nvidia's weakest generational uplift yet. If there ever was a chance for AMD to catch up or beat Nvidia in performance, this was it. This was their chance, but they just couldn't do it. It draws a lot more power then the 5070ti, still sits 8-19% behind Nvidia in raytracing and they are absolutely cooked if Nvidia drops prices anywhere close to 600.\n\nThis is overall a useable win, but AMD should have slammed the 5070ti in performance if they really wanted the marketshare. You're paying for a graphics card half a generation behind for 150 dollars less, worth it? Maybe.",

And buying a new psu just indirectly increases the price of a 9070 XT.\n\nAlso, if AMD can get a good improvement on the next Gen, well i might buy a new gpu in like 2 years or so again. So the 9070 should be fine for that time.\nOverall it should be a pretty decen't upgrade over my 3070.",

I get you want to get a CUDA agnostic benchmark, but there is no way that a 4070 Ti with half the memory bandwidth of a 7900XTX manages almost double the performance in text generation in any real world scenario.\n\nedit: edit: RED FLAG! I looked up the UL Procyon documentation, their scoring formula and which quants they are running. Now if they use INT4 with sparsity, then these test favor nVidia... except the 7900XTX has so much more raw FP16 and memory bandwidth, its AI TOPS should be competitive in dense INT4 compared to the 4070 and 3080. Yet they lose horribly. Why? Their scoring equation divides a \"constant value\" by the time to first token to calculate their \"score\" ‚Äîif time to first token takes dozens of seconds to minutes, then maybe this would be a balanced test, but it don't‚Äîit takes less then 1 second across all their prompt, it's basically a multiplier, because they use a very small context window (2k) while their entire phi-3.5 benchmark take maybe 1-2 minutes in total to complete 7 prompts. \n\nGPU A (*cough*4090*cough*) can complete the Phi-3.5-mini benchmark is less than 50 seconds, with a average TTFT of around 0.25s, scoring 5000 points! But if GPU B has an average TTFT of 0.50s (adding 1.75 seconds total in the full benchmark); this would instantly halve their score. GPU B would have to generate double the tokens/s and complete the test in half the time to overcome this discrepancy in (memory) latency to get an equal score, despite being obviously better in such a case.\n\nTo give you an idea of how much this TTFT part of their scoring equation biases the test, and another major RED FLAG, is the 9070 score; RDNA4 should perform 4-8 times better in int4 OPs than RDNA3 architecturally, and the 9070's have more AI TOPS than the 5070's. They should generating more tokens/second in theory, especially in a benchmark that isn't using CUDA. How much more? About 50%. Yet, it's the 5070's that score 50% higher! And they lose to the 7900 XTX also. The only advantage the XTX have over the 9070 is higher memory bandwidth, yet memory bandwidth doesn't seem to determine the outcome of this benchmark anywhere else.",

I mean obviously this will matter more since these are mainline cards and not an afterthought special edition but still. I don't see myself parting with my steel legend 7900GRE for at least another gen, especially since AMD is bringing FSR4 to 7000 (its in the works apparently, as they said during a talk at CES).

The 9070XT is ok I guess but at 600$ that is still too much for all these years of waiting  for a proper gaming value champion! Rumor has it that the 9060XT has 8gb and 16gb options that will sell for the same awful price and value as the 4060ti/5060ti. I don't see AMD trying to take that Nvidia X60 crown whatsoever, they are just content on copying and being worse than competition on that level.
