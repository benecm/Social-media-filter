Neither „Transmutation“ nor „nuclear recycling“ will solve any of the problems of nuclear fission. That is not true, there is one solution: just stop producing more nuclear waste every day and use much cheaper and cleaner renewable energy. Nuclear fission was an error to begin with, it was mainly done for military reasons on a scale that had to be sold to the public. It always was uneconomical expensive, unpractical and dangerous, as proven several times in history.",
