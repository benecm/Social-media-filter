If you do 'select a,b,c from table' you can instead return it as a row for each a, with a column for each b, and the field value being c, like a spreadsheet. If which case, they're recommending to keep the distinct values of b to < 1024.",

And I was a devops team member and didn't know how and why they find me for support. But hey, I'm happy to help. So we used teamviewer to try to find the problem. After some fiddling, everything seems normal. I suspect it's the anti-virus software he installed stopped the browser from accessing our site. But he insist he didn't put the site to blacklist. Ultimately, I asked he to install wireshark and capture the network and then send the captured data to me. and boom, there's a distinct reset package sent to stop the normal tcp process by his computer. and turns out it's his anti-virus software putting our site into blacklist.\nAlso some other customers complaining about the client app being slow and stuff. It was fun.",

You would be shocked how some databases were designed, developed, maintained especially older Oracle or MS SQL Server.",
